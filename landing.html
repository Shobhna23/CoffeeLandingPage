          <p>
            Coffee lovers around the world who reach for their favorite morning brew probably aren’t
             thinking about its health benefits or risks.
             Before you purchase your next bag of coffee beans, 
             keep in mind that the type of beans you buy, where it was sourced, 
             and how it was roasted will all affect the taste and aroma of your cup of joe. 
             For instance, you can get coffee beans from all over the world,
              but coffee from Hawaii will taste different from coffee beans harvested in Brazil or Ethiopia.
               And, according to the National Coffee Association USA, the coffee plant is grown in 
               "more than 50 countries around the world!"
